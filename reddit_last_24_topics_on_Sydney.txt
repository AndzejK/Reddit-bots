Opal transactional error reimbursement and transfer form question
Hey lads, opal machine at Macquarie uni ate my $50 note today without adding it to my opal card and after spending ~30 minutes on the phone with customer service, I was told to fill out the form in the title. Which you have to return to their office in Alexandria.

Has anyone else gone through this and found a way to do it without having to spend money on postage, or a second travel fare to get to their office to drop it off yourself? Kind of ticked off about this whole mess. Thanks in advance.

Which university is best for Computer Science or Software Engineering degree?
I have diploma in software engineering and wanting to get into second year of compsci or swe degree. I would prefer online because that’s how I learn best but for on campus/hybrid, i wouldn’t mind too much maybe. What’s the best uni for comp sci or swe degree?

Here’s what comes to mind

1) UNSW- Bachelor of Engineering Hons (Software Eng): Hybrid
2) UNE- Bachelor of Computer Science (Software Development): Online
3) UOW: Bachelor of Computer Science (Software Engineering): Hybrid
4) CDU: Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours): Online
5) CSU: Bachelor of Computer Science: Online
6) ECU: Bachelor of Computer Science (Software Engineering): Online

I don’t wany to spend too much time, honours degree such as UNSW and CDU are 4 years, ideally I’d want 3 year degree (I’ll jump into second year due to my diploma). However also, internship/work placement is important to me also, and I think UNSW is best at it. Also, another thing that is important is that the uni should be relevant enough or important enough in the eyes of employer, that is my non negotiable, that is important to me

Let me know what you guys think!

When does safety go too far?
Sydney Metro have become so concerned about public safety at some metro stations that they have staff, full time, standing the to tell passengers to 'face forward' the entire time they're on an escalator, just in case the escalator suddenly stops. I miss the days when we had stairs.

Renting in Sydney - As a tenant, how do I tactfully request a different property manager?
Have had the same real estate agency my entire tenancy (over 5 years) and had 3 different agents as my property manager during that time. 

Unfortunately, the new agent is terrible, pushy, rude, harasses me to sign a lease (which i have not had for 5 years since i originally moved in, am just on periodic)...she proceeded to draft a lease anyway despite me saying NO, sent a reminder every two days via email AND text to sign it, I finally told her to please stop sending the reminders and that i never said i would sign one, and then she wanted a REASON i was saying no and that it was "at no cost to me" (which is bs, it is a HUGE cost to me....less notice period by owner given, break lease fee etc) She definitely knows better, she has been an agent for 35 years! 

I have an inspection every few months (never had more than one a year in 40 years of renting) and I am now getting extreme anxiety about my next inspection that she will start harassing me again. She takes copious amounts of photos and opens my bathroom cupboards. I am super neat and tidy and she is a sticky beak and I hate having her here. 

I am scared if I contact the agency and ask for a different property manager it may cause issues and they may kick me out....and as we all know, the market sucks at the moment. But, its affecting my health at this point.......any advice would be so appreciated. thank you!

Getting a car license at 33, had motorbike license for 15+ years.
I'm having trouble finding information on the Service NSW website.

My dad has been trying to convince me to get into a car ever since I got my riding license, because motorbike dangerous. It's gotten to the point he's offered me his old car for free if I just get my car license, and that's finally tipped me over the edge.

He seems completely convinced that because I'm over 25 and have held a full (R class) license for so long, that I can just walk in, pay the license fee, and walk out with a license. No testing or anything. But I can't find *anything* to back this up. I always thought that it just meant I have to do less logbook hours on L's, but otherwise all the testing- knowledge tests and practical driving tests- were still the same.

Everything else aside, it seems like it would be a really bad idea to give someone a license just because they know the road rules from driving a *completely different type of vehicle* for 15 years. The closest I've ever come to driving a car is sim racing PC games lol.

TL;DR Can anyone point me to a source for what the actual process would be for upgrading to a C class license for someone over 30 who has already held a full R license for 15 years? I'll call them if I have to but god I hate phones lol.

Split system air con - does anyone know how to fix this issue?
Our split system air con has these flashing lights and the unit won’t turn on. I cleaned the filters under the lid a couple of weeks ago thinking it would solve the problem, it helped for a few days but then the flashing lights came back on and the unit stopped working again. I tried resetting the unit by flipping the electrical switch in the garage off and back on, it helped for about an hour and then the lights came back on. Has anyone come across this issue and knows how to fix it?

Rent increase coming. Any advice?
We have recently received a rent increase notice from the landlord from $620 to $720 for our 1 bedroom apartment.

We signed for a 6 months lease back then and it’s ending in June. So the increase will be in effect by then if we are to sign on for a new lease.

I have a place which was meant to settle back in March and has now been postponed to September.

We don’t really want to move since it’s only 3 months away from the new place being settled (if they don’t postponed that is), but the price increase is just way out of our budget.

My questions:

- what’s a good way to negotiate with the landlord? They are well aware of our situation, waiting for the new place to settle

- do I try signing a 3 months contract? Can they increase the rent in September?

- if the landlord wouldn’t budge and we decide to move out, when do we need to notify the landlord? Do we need to reply to the rent increase notice?

Thank you

I feel like I can’t get ahead living in Sydney. It’s just so flipping expensive to live here. This “Sydney salary premium” people talk about doesn’t really seem to hold up in reality.
In my field (engineering), you can get the same money in smaller cities like Brisbane from what I can see on seek and word of mouth. Just venting on the costs of living! It’s crippling and I’m a high income earner paying the single tax. Can’t even imagine how much people are struggling earning less.

Any speech pathologists here? I'm a year 12 student (17F) interested in the profession and would like some input!
I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this but I've been having trouble finding information online about speech pathology/therapy as a career in Australia.

 I've been interested in allied health careers for a while and I recently discovered speech pathology, and it sounds like a great, interesting and rewarding career. 

Below are a few questions I have. You don't need to answer all of them, but I would appreciate some pointers!

1. I'm someone who gets very bored with repetitiveness. I want variety and I want to constantly be exposed to interesting and new things/concepts. Is this something that I can expect to find as a speech pathologist?
2. What is your current salary? I have heard before that there is a 'ceiling' that most allied health careers hit where people struggle to make beyond 110-120k p.a. Is this true? Do you know of any way to move beyond this (e.g. further education, specialisation, starting a private practice...)?
3. How is your work-life balance? On average, how many hours do you work a day/week? How much of this is directly with patients and how much is admin?
4. How satisfied are you with your job and the regulations surrounding your work? During the pandemic, there's been a lot of discontent in careers like nursing and teaching because of poor pay and working conditions. Is this something that's prevalent in SLPs as well?
5. What do you love most about your job?
6. What do you dislike the most about your job?
7. Uni recommendations?
8. What is something you do/treat that most people would be surprised to learn about?
9. Any other advice/recommendations?

Thank you!

Strange string of lights over the skies of Sydney 🤷
Currently as I type this out the time is 4:40am, I'm sitting on my front porch and a little while ago I noticed a plane flying over head, according to flight radar it was a small plane VH-ISS that flew over my house however shortly after the plane flew past and headed north from Bankstown Airport I noticed a strange string of lights that remained in the distance.

At first I thought it was a star but the more I looked I realised it can't be since it's long and thin kinda like a string of tiny pearls glinting in the night sky.  I thought it might be the International Space Station but checking the NASA Tracking site it appears the space station is currently over the Atlantic just east of Canada so it can't be that.  

My question is has anybody else seen it?  From where I am(Wetherill Park) it appears to be in the direction of Cabramatta/Liverpool.  It's completely wierded me out and it's still hanging there in the same spot 🤷
